# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Data-Visualizer-in-MATLAB
A team of environmental researchers is collecting real-time air quality data from various sensors deployed across a large metropolitan area. The goal of this project is to create a MATLAB tool that can visualize this live sensor data using a public dataset.
